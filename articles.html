    <h3> 1. Experimental Stat Focus (Kyle Downing)</h3>
    <p>The KyStat Analytics company researches and develops new sport statistical categories. Stats are crucial in understanding a teams’/platers’ performance. Each major sport has a set of statistical categories that are unique to that sport. Boxscore refers to the summary of a game by recording statistical categories of every player played on both teams. Boxscore data can be traced back to the late 1800s. We can thank Mr. Henry Chadwick. The first baseball boxscore looks different from the one that we see today; this is the same with basketball. Some of the most important statistical categories that we look at in basketball weren’t around in the early start of professional basketball. A few examples are blocks, steals and offensive rebounds. Not to mention that the 3 point line wasn’t implemented into the NBA until the 1979-80 season.  Stats and analytics are always changing as well. I have mainly looked at the development of basketball statistics. I have developed 13 new experimental stats and have data on 10 of them. I will sometimes refer to the stats that I have developed as KyStats. This website will contain information on each stat, including definition, analysis, tables, and graphs.</p>
    <p>Now let's look at an example of one of these KyStats I've developed: MT(Meaningful Touch). MT - Meaningful touch is the sum of Field goals made, Free Throws made, rebounds, Assists, Steals, and Blocks for one team. This looks at every time a player does something positive to affect the game. An example of this stat comes from game one of round one of the bulls finals run in 1992; FG=47, FT=19, TRB=44, AST=33, STL= 8, BLK= 6; add up all these data points to get MT=157. This number gives us a glimpse of the box score with just one number. You’d think that the team that has a higher MT was the winner. For most of the time that is true but not definite. This shows us that a team could have a good performance and still lose a game.</p>
    <p>This website will document the process of creating new stats from start to finish. With more research within each stat this helps better understand statistics and in turn create more statistics that build upon each other. These experimental stat points are mainly focused on team data but with further research and slight adjustments many of these new statistics could also be adapted to work with individual players. Furthermore this website will dive into the topic of stats and how stats can be even more analyzed to better understand the mechanics of sports. Please check out other pages to see more KyStats.

    <h3> 2. Defensive KyStat Idea (Kyle Downing)</h3>
    <p>In the NBA there is more of a focus on a player’s performance on offense than on defense. When looking at how well a basketball player does on defense we primarily look at 2 stats; steals and blocks. One NBA player believes that shouldn’t be the only way we analyze a player's defensive performance. That player is Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat and he talks about how the DOPY(Defensive Player Of the Year) is a misinterpreted award. He thinks the award should be about getting stops and less about just steals and blocks. I think he makes a valid point. </p>
    <p>I came up with an idea for a stat that would look at each defensive possession. In each defensive possession there are only 3 things that can occur: a made shot, missed shot, or shot not taken. Within each of those 3 possibilities are subsets of those outcomes. On a missed shot there could be a rebound either offensive or defensive. Another thing that could happen in a defensive possession is a foul. This foul could be a shooting foul or on the floor foul, leading to shooting free throws or not. A defensemen could also block a player's shot or get a steal. Now that we have covered all these possibilities we can assign each outcome a point unit. </p>
    <p>-Block/Steal = 3 points <br>
        -Matchup missing shot = 2 points<br>
        -Defensive Rebound = 2 points <br>
        -Matchup not shooting = 1 point <br>
        -Matchup making shot = -1 point <br>
        -Matchup getting offensive rebound = -1 point <br>
        -foul leading to free throws is -½ per free throw made <br>
        -foul leading to inbound is -1 point <br>
        </p>
        <p>The next part of this stat is how the points get distributed on each defensive possession. Fouls, blocks/steals, and defensive rebounds are objective when it comes to who is getting assigned the points. Since there are switches on defense and zone defense, this causes some of the point allocation to be subjective. So for the other cases the point assignment will get distributed to the player that is closest to the occurrence of the event. Let's look at an example. On the first play of a game, if a player shoots the ball and it goes in, the defense men closest to the shooter will be given -1 point while the rest of the defenders are given 1 point. Since the other defense men didn’t get scored on they get rewarded by having a positive point and the defense that got shot on gets a negative point. By the end of the game each player will have a series of numbers. These numbers will be added up to give each player their own defensive score. With this system a game would have to be watched in full to track all the points. I will track these points in one game and update soon in another article.</p>

            <h3> 3. 4Level Scorer (Kyle Downing)</h3>
            <p>The newest KyStat that has been developed and implemented is called 4L, which stands for 4 level scorer. There are 4 types of scoring: 2 pointers, 3 pointers, free throws and assists.  The 4 level scorer looks at how well a team/player can score. In hockey, assists count as a point in a player's stats. 4L is one of the new experimental stats that is looked at in the Celtics 2024 finals run data set. While 4L is currently being implemented as a team stat, I believe that this would be better implemented as a player stat. Also I’ve made the decision to count 3 pointers twice because they are included in field goals made as well as 3 pointers made. Three pointers are also worth more.</p>
            <p>Lets look at data from the 2024 Celtics finals performance. In the first game of the playoffs the Celtics made 39 field goals, 22 3 points, 14 free throws, and 27 assists. We can add up all those numbers to get a 4L of 102. In 19 games the Celtics averaged 93.26 4L while their opponents averaged 83.16 4L. The Celtics maximum 4L in those games was 116 while their opponent was 113. The minimum 4L for the Celtics was 73 and their opponents were 63. We can see that the Celtics had about 10 more 4L opportunities than their opponent. </p>
            <p>I think an iteration of 4L could also implement offensive rebounds because that also creates offensive opportunities. If this stat gets adapted to look at a players’ 4L then that could help us understand who is crucial to a team’s offense. For more data on the 4L please look at the datasets.</p>
