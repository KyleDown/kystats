    <h3> 1. Experimental Stat Focus (Kyle Downing) 1/16/2025 !!</h3>
    <p>With all of these experimental stats hopefully a few will show some correlation for wins or any other interesting finds. Also there has been an increase of statistical analysis with in sports. Stats like MT(Meaningful Touch) and PAP(Possible Acumulated Points) further help to better understand basketball and the analysis of the parts that affect a game on a nightly bases. With more research within each stat this help better understand statistics and in turn create more statistics that build upon each other. Many new stats that Downing has come up with build upon the idea of “manipulating the box score stats”. These experimental stat points are mainly focused on team data but with further research and slight adjustment many of these new statistics could also be adapted to work with individual players
        Furthermore this website will dive into the topic of stats and how stats can be even more analyzed to better understand the mechanics of the game. </p>
