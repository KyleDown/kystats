    <p>Stat Explanations with calculators</p>

    <h1>KyStat Explanation</h1>

    <h3>1. MT MeaningfulTouch:</h3>
    <p>Meaningful Touch is a category that sums up all the (FG+3P+FT+TRB+AST+STL+BLK) that are registered.</p>
    <p>Times that team did something to the ball that affected the game in a positive way.</p>
    <p>3P is counted for in FG but I think it's important to give it credit again since 3>2.</p>
    <p>EX: (FG=47, 3P=0, FT=19, TRB=44, AST=33, STL= 8, BLK= 6) MT= 157</p>

    <P>--------</p>

    <h3>2. PP PlayersPlayed:</h3>
    <P>Simply how many players played? This stat is more a side kick stat.</P>
    <p>Notice if a team's lineup is becoming more tight.</p>
    <p>Regular season will probably play more players than they do in the playoffs. Pre pre-season usually plays more players.</p>
    <p>EX: Bulls - SP, MJ, HG, JP, BC, WP, BJA, SW, BH, CH, CL  PP=11</p>

    <P>--------</p>

    <h3>3. YE YearsEx:</h3>
    <P>This calculates all the years of experience the players have.</P>
    <p>Shows how experienced teams are compared to their opponent.</p>
    <p>EX: The Bulls in 1992 ECF1 have a YE=66 while there Opp the heat have YE= 27</p>

    <P>--------</p>

    <h3>4. TP TeamsPlayed</h3>
    <P>What teams in the NBA/ABA are being represented</P>
    <p>Teams are only counted once, so the max is 30. So this could be represented as a percentage as well.</p>
    <p> The data to get this value could be saved and see if any team shows up more than others.</p>
    <p>Ex: Bulls 1992 - 1.Bulls, 2.Spurs, 3.Jazz, 4.Kings, 5.Bucks, 6.Suns, 7.Clippers, 8.Pistons, 9.Hawks - TP=9</p>

    <P>--------</p>

    <h3>5. TAS TotalAllStar </h3>
    <P>This will show how much star power a team has.</P>
    <p>Total number of all star appearances. Some say this could influence referee descion making.</p>
    <p>EX: Bulls 1992 - MJ=7 and SP=4 - TAS=11</p>
    
    <P>--------</p>

    <h3>6. StartsStarting </h3>
    <P>How many starts does the starting lineup have?</P>
    <p>This stat starts at the beginning. </p>
    <p>This shows how much chemistry a team has together.</p>
    <p>EX: Bulls 1992 - (MJ=82, SP=80, HG=79, JP=8, BC=3  +another 5 for that game) SS=330</p>

    <P>--------</p>
        
    <h3>7. PAP PossibleAcumulatedPoints </h3>
    <P>This calculates all the attempts together to get a possible accumulated point total.</P>
    <p>This category could be incorrect because if the team had multiple attempts in one run in reality they would have only scored once in the run.</p>
    <p>This is a fun category because the higher it is, the worse it can be bad.</p>
    <p>With this information it puts into perspective all the shots taken. </p>
    <p>The equation for this category is ((FGA-3PA)x2)+(3PAx3)+FTA = PAP</p>
    <p>EX: Bulls 1992 - (FGA= 86, 3PA=0, FTA= 24) PAP=196</p>

    <P>--------</p>
        
    <h3>8. CE CoachExperience </h3>
    <P>This is how many years of experience a coach has at that time of the game.</P>
    <p>This could be changed to show amount of wins a coach has instead of years coached</p>
    <p>EX: Bulls coach was coaching for 2 years before the year 1992 so CE=2</p>

    <P>--------</p>
        
    <h3>9. AssistsTOV </h3>
    <P>This category shows the ratio of being able to control the ball or not.</P>
    <p>This stat is already a universal stat so still needs some adjusting.</p>
    <p>EX: (AST = 33 /or- TTOV = 12) AT% = 2.73 and AT= +21</p>

    <P>--------</p>
        
    <h3>10. BT BadTouch </h3>
    <P> A simple sum of the TOV and Fouls a team makes.</P>
    <p>This needs more thought to be a fully effective stat.</p>
    <p>EX: TOV=12, PF=21 making BT=33</p>

    <P>--------</p>

    <h3>11. DS DefensivePoint</h3>
    <P>This stems from triple/double doubles and turns it into a team stat</P>
    <p>Russel Westbrook would be scoring 3 points for his team every night</p>
    <p>For example 5 players on the Celtics pre season game vs the 76ers scored in the double digits for points and 2 registered double digit rebounds.</p>
    <p>EX: So the stat sheet would have a DS=7.</p>

    <P>--------</p>

    <h3>12. DP DefensivePoint</h3>
    <P>This stat is interesting because it shows how defensive a team is.</P>
    <p>On the stat sheet it looks like a good defensive night but it's important to see how everyone as a collective unit is on defense.</p>
    <p>the max score is PlayersPlayed times 2</p>
    <p>EX: Bulls 1992 - SP=1, MJ=2, HG=1, BJA=1, WP=1 so the DP=6</p>
